# Factors Influencing Student Performance – SQL & Tableau Analysis

This project explores how various factors like study time, attendance, demographics, and personal habits affect students’ final academic performance.

## Tools Used
- **PostgreSQL**: for data storage and SQL querying
- **SQL**: complex queries with CTEs and aggregations
- **Tableau**: for interactive visualizations
- **Pandas**: used for data cleaning

## Key Analyses
- Study time vs final grade
- Absence patterns vs performance
- Gender and age trends
- Parental education influence
- Romantic relationships and grade outcomes

## Tableau Visualizations

![Studytime vs Grades](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/341d2b30-16c5-47c5-9b94-2ba71e3889e0)
*Study time significantly correlates with higher grades.*

![Absences vs Grades](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a58fe81-e565-47ca-864f-6a08a8036c13)
*Increased absences are directly correlated with a decline in average academic performance.*

![Studytime vs Failures](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d4f1d2a-c36f-4f63-ac24-ac7aa051f04a)
Students with low study time and multiple past failures consistently score the lowest grades.

![Parent Education vs Grades](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f4ede40-444c-4d30-8fd0-a35c371bbc8b)
*Students with higher-educated parents tend to perform better.*

![Sex and Age vs Grades](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a49b16a2-e2c2-4ea0-a95f-ddfee0225c2d)
*Female students generally outperform male students across all age groups, with the performance gap widening slightly as age increases.*

![Romantic Relationship vs Grades](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3007def6-359d-47d2-b761-4456dd668322)
*Students not involved in romantic relationships show higher average grades than those who are.*
